# Intro
CIBMTR Direct FHIR does not currently support this Patient profile for CRID lookup/creation.
It is a forward looking effort to define what would be needed once a true FHIR operation is 
developed and supported. Currently, CRID lookup/creation is carried out using a non-FHIR custom JSON object
as described in the "Direct FHIR Connection Guide".
