This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) describes how to send data to CIBMTR via HL7&#174; FHIR&#174;.   
  
### Introduction
  
The [Center for International Blood &amp; Marrow Transplant Research速 (CIBMTR速)](https://www.cibmtr.org)
is a research collaboration between the [National Marrow Donor Program速 (NMDP)/Be The Match速](https://bethematch.org) 
and the [Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW)](https://www.mcw.edu). 
The CIBMTR collaborates with the global scientific community to advance hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT) and other cellular therapy worldwide to increase survival and enrich 
quality of life for patients. 


The CIBMTR facilitates critical observational and interventional research through scientific 
and statistical expertise, a large network of transplant centers, and a unique and extensive clinical outcomes database.
CIBMTR collects data for HCT recipients using a web-based manual data entry system 
([FormsNet](https://www.cibmtr.org/DataManagement/SystemApplications/FormsNet3)) 
and an automated messaging system 
([A Growable Network Information System (AGNIS)](https://www.cibmtr.org/DataManagement/SystemApplications/AGNIS/Pages/default.aspx)).


CIBMTR is now collecting data through the [HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources&#174; (FHIR&#174;)](http://hl7.org/fhir) standard. 
This IG describes the technical specification that CIBMTR accepts from third party clients producing FHIR resources for reporting HCT data.
It is primarily based on the [US Core FHIR IG](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/) which defines the minimum conformance 
requirements for accessing patient data. Profiles from the [minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) IG](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/), which describes 
the a core set of structured data elements for oncology, are also used.


Initially, this IG is focused on information required for sending Patient demographic data that is necessary for creating or retrieving a CIBMTR 
Research ID (CRID), and for reporting Patient resources with a known CRID. It also includes reporting laboratory observations,
focusing on a set of variables that have been identified as a priority for the CIBMTR Data Transformation Initiative in Fiscal Year 2022. And we have 
begun describing how medication-related resources may be reported, specifically in the context of CIBMTR Form 2400.
