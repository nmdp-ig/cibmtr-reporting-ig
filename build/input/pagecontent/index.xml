  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
  The <a href="https://www.cibmtr.org">Center for International Blood &amp; Marrow Transplant Research速 (CIBMTR速)</a>
  is a research collaboration between the <a href="https://bethematch.org/">National Marrow Donor Program速 (NMDP)/Be The Match速</a> 
  and the <a href="https://www.mcw.edu/">Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW)</a>. 
  The CIBMTR collaborates with the global scientific community to advance hematopoietic cell 
  transplantation (HCT) and other cellular therapy worldwide to increase survival and enrich 
  quality of life for patients. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The CIBMTR facilitates critical observational and interventional research through scientific 
  and statistical expertise, a large network of transplant centers, and a unique and extensive clinical outcomes database.
  CIBMTR collects data for HCT recipients using a web-based manual data entry system 
  (<a href="https://www.cibmtr.org/DataManagement/SystemApplications/FormsNet3">FormsNet</a>) 
  and an automated messaging system 
  (<a href="https://www.cibmtr.org/DataManagement/SystemApplications/AGNIS/Pages/default.aspx">A Growable Network Information System (AGNIS)</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
  CIBMTR is now collecting data through the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir">HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</a> standard. 
  This IG describes the technical specification that CIBMTR accepts from third party clients producing FHIR resources for reporting HCT data.
  It is primarily based on the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/">US Core FHIR IG</a> which defines the minimum conformance 
  requirements for accessing patient data. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Initially, this IG is focused on information required for sending Patient demographic data that is necessary for creating or retrieving a CIBMTR 
  Research ID (CRID), and for reporting Patient resources with a known CRID. We have also begun specifying a profile for reporting laboratory observations, 
  focusing on a set of variables that have been identified as a priority for the CIBMTR Data Transformation Initiative in Fiscal Year 2021.
