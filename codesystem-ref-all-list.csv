Specifically, the identifier can be used as the coded value for an observation in any other standard that uses the observation/observation value paradigm, whether messages, documents, application programming interface (API), etc. For example, LOINC codes are used widely in the OBX segment Observation Identifier field (OBX-3) of an ORU HL7 (HL7 version 2.x or ASTM 1238-9410) message that may be sent between a Clinical Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR).5, 6 In this way, LOINC codes provide universal identifiers that allow the exchange of clinical data between heterogeneous computing environments.","ValueSet/cibmtr-priority-variables-2021,ValueSet/leukocyte-morphology-blood-vs,ValueSet/cibmtr-priority-variables-2022,ValueSet/cbc-w-differential-unspecified-blood-vs,ValueSet/smear-morphology-blood-vs,ValueSet/cbc-blood-automated-vs,ValueSet/auto-differential-blood-vs,ValueSet/cibmtr-priority-variables-epic-2021,ValueSet/erythrocyte-morphology-blood-vs,ValueSet/manual-differential-blood-vs,ValueSet/presence-valueset,ValueSet/platelet-morphology-blood-vs,ValueSet/variant-inheritance-vs,ValueSet/observation-codes,ValueSet/differential-unspecified-blood-vs"
